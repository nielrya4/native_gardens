<h3>Why Rewild?</h3>
<p>
    Rewilding a part of your yard will benefit you and native pollinators, as well as increase
    native biodiversity around you. This can look like more butterflies and hummingbirds,
    adding new herbs and berries to your diet, brightening up your property, having a low-maintenance
    garden that looks great, and learning about what grows natively in our State.

<h4>How To Use This Site</h4>
<h6>Native Plant Lists</h6>
<p>
    This tab contains information about what plants grow locally, the conditions they prefer,
    and how to take care of them. It also describes some of their many uses! NOTE that all
    edible/medicinal information here should be double and triple checked. Before ingesting
    any part of any plant, the identification must be certain. Make sure you're not allergic
    to any relatives of a plant you plan to eat. Do your research, be safe, and have fun!
    These tables also contain links that point to where the plants can be purchased. If they are
    out of stock, simply google another place they can be purchased. Some of the best seed providers
    for native Idaho plants are
    <a href="https://snakeriverseeds.com/" target="_blank">Snake River Seed Cooperative</a>
    and <a href="https://klamathsiskiyouseeds.com/" target="_blank">Klamath-Siskiyou Native Seeds</a>.
</p>
<h6>Climate Map of Idaho</h6>
<p>
    This tab has an interactive map that shows what the coldest winter temperatures are across Idaho.
    Use this in conjunction with the cold hardiness temperatures listed on the plants page to decide what
    is suitable to grow in your area. For example, Longleaf Groundcherry will grow great in the red and
    orange areas, but not so well in the cyan and blue areas. Put your address in the search bar to
    easily find what kind of climate your yard is in.

<h4>Our Yards: America's "New National Park"</h4>
<p>
    If we replaced half of the lawns in the United States with native plant landscaping, we would have
    created a 20,000,000 acre "National Park" without having to pass any legislation. For scale,
    Yellowstone is 1/10th of that size, ~2,200,000 acres. You may not want to replace your whole lawn
    with native plants, and that is ok! Adding any amount of native plants will benefit your property
    and contribute to the "New National Park." If you're interested in this concept, make sure to check
    out the work being done over at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://homegrownnationalpark.org/about-us/">Homegrown National Park</a>!

<h4>Habitat Haven</h4>
<p>
    If you are interested in putting in a native garden, and you live in Southeastern Idaho, check out the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://sagebrushlandtrust.org/habitat-haven/">Habitat Haven</a> initiative by the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://sagebrushlandtrust.org/">Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust</a>. This is a great way to
    familiarize yourself with native plants and get to know some people in the area whose interests align with your own!
    They are always at the Portneuf Valley Environmental Fair.
